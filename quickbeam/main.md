**Phase 1: Basic Peer-to-Peer Connection (No File Transfer Yet)**

1. **HTML Structure (index.html):**
    
    - Create a basic HTML file with:
        - Head section for title and any basic styles.
        - A body with:
            - Two main sections (or divs), one for each "peer." Label them clearly (e.g., "Peer A" and "Peer B").
            - Within each peer section:
                - A text area or input field for displaying/entering the "code" or session ID.
                - Buttons for "Create Code," "Join Code," and "Connect."
                - A text area to log messages (e.g., signaling messages, connection status).
2. **Client-Side JavaScript (script.js):**
    
    - Create a JavaScript file to handle the WebRTC logic.
    - **Variables:**
        - `localPeerConnection`: To hold your `RTCPeerConnection` object.
        - `sendChannel`: To hold your `RTCDataChannel` object (you'll create this later).
        - `code`: A variable to store the generated or entered session code.
    - **Event Listeners:**
        - **"Create Code" Button:**
            - Generate a simple unique code (e.g., a random string).
            - Display this code in the designated input field.
            - **Crucially, for local testing, this "code" will be how you manually coordinate between the two browser tabs/windows you'll open on your local network.** You'll copy the code from one and paste it into the other.
            - Potentially log a message indicating the code was created.
        - **"Join Code" Button:**
            - Get the code entered by the user.
            - Log a message indicating the attempt to join.
        - **"Connect" Button (This will have different logic for the "creating" and "joining" peer):**
            - **Creator:** When the "creator" clicks connect, you'll:
                - Create a new `RTCPeerConnection`.
                - Add an event listener for `icecandidate` to send ICE candidates to the "joining" peer (you'll handle this manually for now - logging them to the console).
                - Create an `RTCDataChannel` using `localPeerConnection.createDataChannel('fileTransferChannel')`. Add event listeners for `open`, `close`, `message` (for later file transfer), and `error`.
                - Create an SDP offer using `localPeerConnection.createOffer()` and then `localPeerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer)`.
                - Log the generated SDP offer to the console (the "creator" will manually copy this).
            - **Joiner:** When the "joiner" clicks connect, you'll:
                - Create a new `RTCPeerConnection`.
                - Add an event listener for `icecandidate` to send ICE candidates to the "creator" (log to console).
                - Add an event listener for the `datachannel` event on the `RTCPeerConnection`. When a data channel is opened by the other peer, store it in your `sendChannel` variable and set up its `open`, `close`, `message`, and `error` listeners.
                - You'll need to manually paste the SDP offer from the creator into a prompt or text area in the "joiner" window. Then, you'll use `localPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(offer))` (where `offer` is the pasted SDP).
                - Create an SDP answer using `localPeerConnection.createAnswer()` and then `localPeerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer)`.
                - Log the generated SDP answer to the console (the "joiner" will manually copy this).
                - You'll need to manually paste the SDP answer from the joiner into a prompt or text area in the "creator" window and use `localPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer))`.
                - Similarly, you'll need to manually exchange ICE candidates logged in the console between the two peers using prompts or text areas and the `localPeerConnection.addIceCandidate()` method.
3. **Running Locally:**
    
    - Open `index.html` in two separate browser tabs or windows on the same computer (or on different computers on the same local network).
    - Use the buttons and the console to manually simulate the signaling process:
        - In one tab (Peer A), click "Create Code" and then "Connect." Copy the generated SDP offer and any ICE candidates from the console.
        - In the other tab (Peer B), enter the same code and click "Connect." Paste the SDP offer and any ICE candidates from Peer A. Copy Peer B's SDP answer and ICE candidates from its console and paste them into Peer A's window.
    - Observe the `datachannel` `open` event in both browser consoles. If you see this, your basic P2P connection is working!

**Phase 2: Basic File Transfer**

1. **UI Enhancements:**
    
    - Add a file input (`<input type="file">`) to the "sender" peer's section.
    - Add a button to initiate the file send.
2. **File Reading and Chunking (Sender):**
    
    - Add an event listener to the file input's `change` event to get the selected file.
    - When the "send" button is clicked:
        - Read the file using the `FileReader` API (likely using `readAsArrayBuffer` for binary data).
        - Implement logic to chunk the file into smaller pieces (e.g., based on a fixed size like 16KB or 64KB).
        - Send each chunk over the `sendChannel` using `sendChannel.send(chunk)`.
        - Consider sending metadata first (filename, file size) as a separate message so the receiver knows what to expect.
3. **File Reassembly (Receiver):**
    
    - In the `datachannel`'s `message` event listener:
        - Check if the received data is metadata or a file chunk.
        - If it's a chunk, store it in a buffer or array.
        - Once all chunks are received (you might need to send an "end of file" message), reassemble the file. You can use `Blob` and `URL.createObjectURL()` to create a downloadable link for the user.
4. **Progress Indication (Optional but Recommended):**
    
    - Implement a progress bar or text indicator on the sender's side to show how much of the file has been sent. You can calculate this based on the number of chunks sent and the total file size.

**Phase 3: Refinement and Local Signaling Simulation**

1. **Abstract Signaling:** Instead of manual copy-pasting, you could simulate a very basic local signaling mechanism. For example:
    - When a peer creates a code, store their `RTCPeerConnection` and any generated SDP/ICE candidates in a simple in-memory object (if both peers are in the same browser) or using `localStorage` (if in separate tabs/windows).
    - When a peer joins a code, retrieve the stored information and proceed with `setRemoteDescription` and `addIceCandidate`. **This is still not a real network-based signaling server, but it makes local testing much smoother.**

**This step-by-step plan allows you to build and test the core WebRTC and file transfer logic without the immediate overhead of deploying a signaling server. Once you have the local transfer working, you can then focus on building and deploying your signaling server (using one of the free tier options discussed earlier) to enable connections between different devices on different networks.**

Good luck with your coding! Start with the basic connection, get the data channel working, and then tackle the file transfer. You'll learn a lot along the way.
