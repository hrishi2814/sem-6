### JSP
- **Java Server Pages (JSP)*** is a server-side technology that creates dynamic web applications. It allows developers to embed Java code directly into HTML or XML pages, and it makes web development more efficient.

- JSP is an advanced version of Servlets. It provides enhanced capabilities for building scalable and platform-independent web pages.

### JSP v/s Servlet

- JSP code is easier to manage than Servlets as it separates UI and business logic.
- JSP minimizes the amount of code required for web applications.
- Generate content dynamically in response to user interactions.
- It provides access to the complete range of Java APIs for robust application development.
- JSP is suitable for applications with growing user bases.

### Key Features of JSP

- It is platform-independent; we can write once, run anywhere.
- It simplifies database interactions for dynamic content.
- It contains predefined objects like request, response, session, and application, reducing development time.
- It has built-in mechanisms for exception and error management.
- It supports custom tags and tag libraries.

## JSP Architecture

JSP follows a three-layer architecture:

- ***Client Layer****: The browser sends a request to the server.
- ***Web Server Layer****: The server processes the request using a JSP engine.
- ***Database/Backend Layer****: Interacts with the database and returns the response to the client.
