Cloud computing introduces several **security risks** due to its shared, on-demand, and internet-based nature. Here's a detailed breakdown of the **different types of security risks** in cloud computing:

---

## **1. Data Breaches**

- **Unauthorized access** to sensitive data stored in the cloud (personal info, IP, credentials).
- May occur due to misconfigurations, weak passwords, or vulnerabilities in the app.

---

## **2. Data Loss**

- Permanent loss of data due to:
    - Accidental deletion
    - Hardware failure
    - Ransomware attacks
    - Provider errors without backups

---

## **3. Insecure APIs**

- Cloud services expose **APIs** for users/apps to interact with services.
- Poorly designed or unsecured APIs can be exploited to:
    - Gain unauthorized access
    - Inject malicious data
    - Perform denial-of-service attacks

---

## **4. Misconfiguration**

- Common risk where cloud resources (e.g., storage buckets) are unintentionally left public or underprotected.
- Causes: Human error, lack of visibility, or poor access controls.

---

## **5. Insider Threats**

- Employees or third-party vendors who misuse their access to steal, delete, or leak data.
- Hard to detect due to legitimate access privileges.

---

## **6. Account Hijacking**

- If attacker gains access to your cloud credentials (via phishing, brute-force, keylogging), they can:
    - Access sensitive data
    - Launch attacks
    - Impersonate users or admins

---

## **7. Lack of Visibility and Control**

- Cloud abstract layers make it hard for organizations to monitor:
    - Where data is stored
    - Who accesses it
    - What configurations are active
- This affects compliance and risk management.

---

## **8. Denial of Service (DoS / DDoS) Attacks**

- Attackers flood cloud services with traffic, making them unavailable to legitimate users.
- This affects performance, availability, and revenue.

---

## **9. Data Residency & Compliance Risks**

- Cloud data may reside in different geographic locations.
- Risk of violating **data sovereignty laws** like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.

---

## **10. Shared Technology Vulnerabilities**

- In multi-tenant environments, flaws in **hypervisors**, **containers**, or **virtualization** could allow one user to access another’s data or processes.

---

## **11. Shadow IT**

- Use of cloud apps and services without IT department’s approval.
- Risks: untracked data storage, lack of compliance, and no monitoring.

---

## **12. Inadequate Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

- Overly permissive roles
- Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Poor password policies

---

## **Best Practices to Reduce Cloud Security Risks**

- Use **strong IAM policies** and enable MFA.
- Perform **regular audits** and **vulnerability scans**.
- Encrypt data **at rest** and **in transit**.
- Implement **cloud security posture management (CSPM)** tools.
- Use **private networks or VPNs** for sensitive operations.
- Monitor with **SIEM** and **cloud-native monitoring** tools.
- Follow **compliance standards** and regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, etc.).
