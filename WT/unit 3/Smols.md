**i) Process of Transforming XML Document:**

- XML transformation typically involves converting an XML document into another format (like HTML, plain text, or another XML structure) using **XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations)**.
    
- Steps involved:
    
    1. **Parse the XML**: Read the XML document and form a DOM (Document Object Model) tree.
        
    2. **Apply XSLT stylesheet**: Define rules in an XSLT file that specify how to transform the XML elements.
        
    3. **Transform**: Use an XSLT processor (like Xalan or Saxon) to apply the stylesheet to the XML, generating the final output.
        
    4. **Output**: The transformed document could be HTML (for web display), another XML structure, or even text data.

**ii) HTTP Session:**

- An **HTTP session** refers to a series of network interactions between a client (usually a web browser) and a server that are considered part of a single conversation.
    
- Since **HTTP is stateless** (does not retain user information between requests), sessions are used to maintain state.
    
- Mechanisms to maintain an HTTP session:
    
    - **Cookies**: Server sends a cookie to the client, which is returned with subsequent requests.
        
    - **Session ID**: A unique identifier stored on the client side (usually in cookies) to track the session on the server.
        
    - **URL Rewriting**: Embedding the session ID directly in URLs.
        
- Common usage: user login sessions, shopping carts, and personalized settings.
