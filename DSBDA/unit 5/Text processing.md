### 📝 What is Text Processing?

**Text processing** is the technique of analyzing, transforming, and preparing **textual data** (natural language) for further analysis or modeling. It is a key step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** tasks involving text.

## 💡 Purpose of Text Processing

- Clean and structure raw text data.
    
- Make it suitable for algorithms to **understand, classify, or predict**.
    
- Extract useful information and insights.

## 🧱 Common Steps in Text Processing

|Step|Description|
|---|---|
|**1. Tokenization**|Splitting text into individual words or sentences. _Example:_ "I love NLP" → ['I', 'love', 'NLP']|
|**2. Lowercasing**|Converting text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.|
|**3. Removing Punctuation**|Getting rid of commas, periods, etc.|
|**4. Removing Stop Words**|Eliminating common words like _the, is, and_ that add little meaning.|
|**5. Stemming**|Reducing words to their root form. _Example:_ "running" → "run"|
|**6. Lemmatization**|More advanced root word conversion using context and grammar.|
|**7. Vectorization**|Converting text into numerical format (like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or Word2Vec) so that ML models can work on it.|
