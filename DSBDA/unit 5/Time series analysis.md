## 📈 What is Time Series Analysis?

**Time Series Analysis** is a statistical technique used to analyze **data points collected or recorded over time** in sequential order.

Unlike regular datasets, time series data has a **temporal order**, and each data point is typically dependent on past values.

## 🕰 Examples of Time Series Data:

- Stock prices (daily/weekly/monthly)
    
- Weather data (temperature, rainfall over days)
    
- Website traffic (hourly visitors)
    
- Electricity usage per minute
    
- Sales data (monthly revenue)

## 🎯 Purpose of Time Series Analysis

1. **Trend Detection** – Identify long-term increase or decrease in the data.
    
2. **Seasonality Analysis** – Recognize repeating patterns over fixed periods (e.g., sales increase during festivals).
    
3. **Forecasting** – Predict future values based on past behavior.
    
4. **Anomaly Detection** – Spot unexpected spikes or drops (e.g., fraud, sensor failures).
    
5. **Understanding Structure** – Analyze autocorrelation, stationarity, etc.

## 🧱 Key Components of a Time Series

|Component|Description|
|---|---|
|**Trend**|Long-term increase/decrease in data|
|**Seasonality**|Periodic pattern (e.g., daily, monthly, annually)|
|**Cyclic**|Non-fixed long-term fluctuations (e.g., business cycles)|
|**Noise**|Random or irregular variation not explained by the model|

## 🔍 Time Series Analysis Techniques

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|**Moving Average**|Smooths the series to identify trends|
|**Exponential Smoothing**|Weights recent data more heavily|
|**ARIMA**|Combines AutoRegression + Integration + MA|
|**SARIMA**|ARIMA with seasonal component|
|**Prophet (by Facebook)**|Robust forecasting tool for seasonality|
|**LSTM (Deep Learning)**|Used for complex sequential patterns|

## 🛠 Python Libraries for Time Series

- **Pandas** – Handling datetime indices and time-based operations
    
- **statsmodels** – ARIMA, ADF test, decomposition
    
- **scikit-learn** – Feature engineering and ML models
    
- **Prophet** – Forecasting
    
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Deep learning models like LSTM

## 📊 Simple Example of Time Series:

Suppose you have monthly sales data:

```
Jan 2022 → 1200  
Feb 2022 → 1300  
Mar 2022 → 1250  
...  
```

You can:

- Plot it to visualize trends
    
- Apply moving average to smooth it
    
- Use ARIMA to forecast future sales
