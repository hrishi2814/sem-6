## üß≠ **What is Hierarchical Clustering?**

**Hierarchical Clustering** is an **unsupervised machine learning** technique used to group similar data points into a **nested hierarchy of clusters**.

> It builds a **tree-like structure** (called a **dendrogram**) to show how individual data points merge into clusters over time.

## üîÅ **Types of Hierarchical Clustering**

1. **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up)** ‚Äì  
    Start with each data point as its own cluster, then **merge the closest pairs** until one big cluster remains.
    
2. **Divisive (Top-Down)** ‚Äì  
    Start with one big cluster, and **split it repeatedly** into smaller clusters.
    

> Agglomerative is more common in practice.

---

## üîß **How It Works (Agglomerative Approach)**

1. Start with **each point as a separate cluster**.
    
2. Calculate the **distance (similarity)** between all clusters.
    
3. Merge the **two closest clusters**.
    
4. Recalculate distances between clusters.
    
5. Repeat steps 3‚Äì4 until all points are in a single cluster.

## üìä **Visualizing with a Dendrogram**

A **dendrogram** is a tree diagram that shows the **merging process** of clusters.

- The **height** of each U-shaped link shows the **distance** (dissimilarity) between merged clusters.
    
- By cutting the dendrogram at a specific height, you can get the **desired number of clusters**.
    

### üîç **Example:**

Imagine you have 5 animals with data on their features (e.g., weight, speed):

- Dog, Cat, Tiger, Elephant, Cheetah
    

After hierarchical clustering, the dendrogram might show:

- Cat and Dog grouped first ‚Üí Then merged with Tiger ‚Üí Then Cheetah ‚Üí Finally Elephant
    

Cutting the dendrogram at a specific level might result in **2 or 3 meaningful clusters** (e.g., domestic vs wild animals).

## üß™ **Simple Python Example with Dendrogram**

```python
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram, linkage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Sample data (2D points)
data = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [10, 8], [11, 9], [25, 30]])

# Perform hierarchical clustering
linked = linkage(data, method='ward')

# Plot dendrogram
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
dendrogram(linked,
           orientation='top',
           distance_sort='descending',
           show_leaf_counts=True)
plt.title('Dendrogram')
plt.xlabel('Data Points')
plt.ylabel('Distance')
plt.show()
```

## üåç **Real-World Applications of Hierarchical Clustering**

|Domain|Use Case|
|---|---|
|**Biology**|Constructing phylogenetic trees (evolutionary relationships)|
|**Marketing**|Customer segmentation based on behavior|
|**Text Mining**|Grouping similar documents/articles|
|**Social Networks**|Detecting communities|
|**Healthcare**|Grouping similar patients or diseases|
|**Image Processing**|Grouping similar pixels or features|

## ‚úÖ **Advantages**

- No need to pre-specify the number of clusters.
    
- Produces a dendrogram for visualization.
    
- Good for small to medium datasets.
    

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**

- Computationally expensive for large datasets.
    
- Once a merge/split is done, it cannot be undone (greedy approach).
    
- Sensitive to noise and outliers.
