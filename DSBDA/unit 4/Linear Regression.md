## 📘 **What is Linear Regression?**

**Linear Regression** is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for **predicting continuous numerical values** based on the relationship between input (independent) variables and an output (dependent) variable.

It assumes a **linear relationship** between input variables XX and the output YY.

## ✅ **Purpose of Linear Regression**

- To **predict a continuous outcome**.
    
- To understand how changes in input variables affect the output.
    
- To find the **best-fit line** that minimizes the prediction error.

## 🧮 **Linear Regression Equation**

### 🔹 **Simple Linear Regression** (one independent variable):

$Y=β0+β1X+εY = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon$

Where:

- Y: Dependent variable (target)
    
- X: Independent variable (feature)
    
- $\beta_0$: Intercept
    
- $\beta_1$: Slope (coefficient)
    
- $\varepsilon$: Error term
    

### 🔹 **Multiple Linear Regression** (more than one independent variable):

$Y=β0+β1X1+β2X2+…+βnXn+εY = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_n X_n + \varepsilon$

## 🧠 **Types of Linear Regression**

1. **Simple Linear Regression**
    
    - One independent variable
        
    - Example: Predicting height based on age
        
2. **Multiple Linear Regression**
    
    - Multiple independent variables
        
    - Example: Predicting house price based on area, location, and number of rooms
        
3. **Polynomial Linear Regression**
    
    - Input is transformed using polynomial terms
        
    - Can model curved relationships
        
4. **Ridge and Lasso Regression**
    
    - Regularized versions to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients

## 📌 **Key Assumptions**

1. **Linearity** – The relationship between features and target is linear.
    
2. **Independence** – Observations are independent of each other.
    
3. **Homoscedasticity** – Constant variance of errors.
    
4. **Normality** – Residuals (errors) are normally distributed.
    
5. **No multicollinearity** – Independent variables should not be highly correlated.
