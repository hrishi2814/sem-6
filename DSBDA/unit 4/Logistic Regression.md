## 📘 **What is Logistic Regression?**

**Logistic Regression** is a statistical and machine learning algorithm used for **binary or multi-class classification problems**.  
It predicts the **probability** that a given input belongs to a certain class.

➡️ Unlike linear regression (which predicts continuous values), logistic regression predicts **discrete outcomes** (e.g., yes/no, 0/1, spam/not spam).

## ❓ **Need for Logistic Regression**

- **Linear regression is not suitable for classification** because it predicts values outside the range of 0 and 1, which cannot be interpreted as probabilities.
    
- Logistic regression uses a **sigmoid (logistic) function** to map any real-valued number into the (0, 1) range.
    
- It provides a **probabilistic framework** to make decisions:
    
    - If `P(class=1) > 0.5`, classify as **1** (positive class)
        
    - Otherwise, classify as **0** (negative class)

## 🧮 **Logistic (Sigmoid) Function**

The **logistic function** used in logistic regression is:

σ(z)=11+e−z\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}

Where:

- z=β0+β1x1+β2x2+…+βnxnz = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \beta_n x_n
    
- σ(z)\sigma(z) outputs a value between 0 and 1 (interpreted as probability).
    

📌 **Key Property**: S-shaped curve (sigmoid), asymptotically approaches 0 and 1.

## 📚 **Types of Logistic Regression**

### 1. **Binary Logistic Regression**

- ✅ Used when the target variable has **two classes** (e.g., 0 or 1).
    
- 🔍 Example: Predicting whether an email is **spam** or **not spam**.
    

### 2. **Multinomial Logistic Regression**

- ✅ Used when the target variable has **more than two classes** (not ordered).
    
- 🔍 Example: Classifying types of fruits as **apple**, **banana**, or **orange**.
    

### 3. **Ordinal Logistic Regression**

- ✅ Used when the target has **ordered categories** (e.g., low < medium < high).
    
- 🔍 Example: Predicting satisfaction level as **low**, **medium**, or **high**.

## 🔧 Common Use Cases

- Medical diagnosis (e.g., disease present or not)
    
- Credit risk (loan default prediction)
    
- Marketing (whether a customer will respond to an offer)
    
- Image classification (binary or multi-class)
    
- Fraud detection
