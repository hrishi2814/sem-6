### üê∑ **Apache Pig ‚Äì Role in Hadoop Data Processing**

**What is Apache Pig?**  
Apache Pig is a **high-level platform for creating MapReduce programs** used with Hadoop. It simplifies the complexity of writing raw MapReduce code using a scripting language called **Pig Latin**.

#### ‚úÖ **Role in Data Processing Workflows:**

- **Abstraction Over MapReduce**: Allows users to write data analysis tasks without dealing with Java-based MapReduce complexity.
    
- **Data Transformation**: Ideal for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks like filtering, joining, and sorting large datasets.
    
- **Batch Processing**: Suited for processing **static, structured or semi-structured** data in bulk.
    
- **Schema-based**: Works well with schema-based data (like logs or structured datasets).
    

#### üîß Common Use Cases:

- Parsing logs
    
- Joining large datasets
    
- Data cleaning and preprocessing before loading into data warehouses
    

#### üìå Example (Pig Latin Script):

```pig
logs = LOAD 'server_logs.txt' AS (ip:chararray, timestamp:chararray, request:chararray);
filtered = FILTER logs BY request MATCHES '.*GET.*';
GROUPED = GROUP filtered BY ip;
COUNT = FOREACH GROUPED GENERATE group, COUNT(filtered);
DUMP COUNT;
```

### ‚ö° **Apache Spark ‚Äì What it is and How it Complements Hadoop**

**What is Apache Spark?**  
Apache Spark is an **in-memory distributed computing framework** that provides high-speed data processing capabilities and supports multiple workloads (batch, streaming, machine learning, graph processing).

#### ‚úÖ **Why Use Spark with Hadoop?**

- **Speed**: Processes data up to **100x faster** than traditional MapReduce by using **in-memory computation**.
    
- **Flexible APIs**: Supports Java, Scala, Python, and R.
    
- **Versatile**: Goes beyond batch processing ‚Äî supports real-time analytics, machine learning (via MLlib), and streaming (via Spark Streaming).
    
- **Hadoop Integration**: Can run on Hadoop YARN, read data from HDFS, Hive, or HBase.
    

#### üîÑ **How Spark Complements Hadoop:**

|Feature|Hadoop (MapReduce)|Spark|
|---|---|---|
|Processing Type|Batch only|Batch + Streaming + ML|
|Speed|Slower (disk-based)|Faster (in-memory)|
|API Complexity|Low-level (Java-heavy)|High-level (Scala/Python)|
|Fault Tolerance|Yes (HDFS)|Yes (RDD lineage)|
|Use with HDFS|Native support|Native support|

#### üìå Spark Use Cases:

- Real-time analytics (e.g., fraud detection)
    
- Machine learning workflows
    
- Stream processing (e.g., log analysis)
    
- Batch processing faster than MapReduce
