## 🐷 **Apache Pig**

### 🔹 What is Pig?

- High-level platform for processing large datasets in Hadoop using a **scripting language called Pig Latin**.
    
- Developed by Yahoo for **data flow-based** processing.
    

### 🔹 Key Features

- Handles both structured and semi-structured data.
    
- Follows **data flow** language model.
    
- Uses MapReduce in the background.
    
- Easier to write than raw Java MapReduce.
    

### 🔹 Components

1. **Pig Latin** – Language to express data transformations.
    
2. **Pig Engine** – Converts Pig Latin scripts into MapReduce jobs.
    

### 🔹 Execution Modes

- **Local Mode** – Runs on a single JVM, good for small data.
    
- **MapReduce Mode** – Default; runs on Hadoop cluster.
    

### 🔹 Example Use Cases

- Log analysis
    
- ETL pipelines (Extract, Transform, Load)
