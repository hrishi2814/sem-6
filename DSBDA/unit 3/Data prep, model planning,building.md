## üìä Data Analytics Lifecycle: Focused Phases

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preparation**

Also known as **Data Wrangling** or **Data Munging**, this step ensures data is **clean, consistent, and usable** for modeling.

#### üßπ Objectives:

- Clean the data
    
- Integrate data from multiple sources
    
- Convert it into a structured format for analysis
    

#### üß∞ Key Activities:

- **Data Cleaning**:
    
    - Handle missing values (imputation, deletion)
        
    - Remove duplicates
        
    - Correct inconsistent formats (e.g., date formats)
        
    - Outlier detection and treatment
        
- **Data Transformation**:
    
    - Normalization or scaling
        
    - Aggregation (e.g., summing sales by region)
        
    - Feature extraction (e.g., extracting day/month from a timestamp)
        
    - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding)
        
- **Data Integration**:
    
    - Merge data from various sources (databases, APIs, flat files)
        
    - Resolve data conflicts and redundancy
        
- **Feature Selection/Engineering**:
    
    - Select the most relevant variables
        
    - Create new features to improve model performance (e.g., total_price = price √ó quantity)
        

#### üì¶ Outcome:

A **final dataset** ready for exploration and modeling, typically stored in a tabular format.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Planning**

This step involves selecting appropriate modeling techniques and designing the analytical approach.

#### üß† Objectives:

- Decide **how to analyze** the data
    
- Choose the **algorithmic path**
    
- Determine **tools** and **evaluation metrics**
    

#### üß∞ Key Activities:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    
    - Understand distributions, trends, correlations
        
    - Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)
        
- **Hypothesis Generation**:
    
    - Formulate assumptions and business hypotheses
        
- **Model Selection**:
    
    - Choose types of models:
        
        - Classification (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees)
            
        - Regression (e.g., linear regression)
            
        - Clustering (e.g., k-means)
            
- **Metric Selection**:
    
    - Define success metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE)
        
- **Tool Planning**:
    
    - Choose platforms/languages (R, Python, Spark MLlib, etc.)
        

#### üì¶ Outcome:

A **blueprint** for the modeling process, with selected algorithms and evaluation strategies.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Building**

In this step, data scientists **implement** the models using the preprocessed data and planned approach.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Objectives:

- Build and train the model(s)
    
- Optimize parameters
    
- Validate performance
    

#### üß∞ Key Activities:

- **Training**:
    
    - Split data into training and testing sets
        
    - Fit the model on training data
        
- **Validation**:
    
    - Use cross-validation (e.g., k-fold) to avoid overfitting
        
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    
    - Adjust parameters (e.g., learning rate, tree depth)
        
    - Use techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization
        
- **Model Comparison**:
    
    - Try multiple algorithms and compare their performance
        
- **Automation**:
    
    - Use pipelines (e.g., `sklearn.pipeline`) to automate preprocessing and modeling steps
        

#### üì¶ Outcome:

A **trained model** ready for evaluation on test data. At this point, the model is not yet deployed but has shown promising accuracy and performance.
