### üèóÔ∏è **Data Analytics Architecture**

**Data Analytics Architecture** is the structured framework that outlines how data is collected, stored, processed, and analyzed to derive insights. It includes components for data ingestion, storage, processing, analysis, and visualization.

### üìä **Key Components of Data Analytics Architecture**

#### 1. **Data Sources**

Where data originates from:

- Databases (SQL/NoSQL)
    
- IoT Devices & Sensors
    
- Social Media
    
- APIs & Web Services
    
- Enterprise Applications (ERP, CRM)
    

---

#### 2. **Data Ingestion**

How raw data is collected and imported:

- **Batch Ingestion**: Data is collected and processed in chunks (e.g., ETL tools like Talend, Informatica)
    
- **Real-time Ingestion**: Data is streamed live (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis)
    

---

#### 3. **Data Storage**

Where the data is stored after ingestion:

- **Data Warehouse**: Structured data (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake)
    
- **Data Lake**: Raw, unstructured/semi-structured data (e.g., Hadoop HDFS, AWS S3, Azure Data Lake)
    

---

#### 4. **Data Processing & Transformation**

Raw data is cleaned, filtered, and transformed:

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** or **ELT**
    
- Tools: Apache Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, Apache Flink
    
- Processes: Filtering, Aggregation, Enrichment
    

---

#### 5. **Analytics & Machine Learning**

Where insights are generated:

- **Descriptive Analytics** (what happened?)
    
- **Predictive Analytics** (what will happen?)
    
- **Prescriptive Analytics** (what should be done?)
    
- Tools: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), R, SAS, RapidMiner
    

---

#### 6. **Data Visualization & Reporting**

Make data accessible and understandable:

- Dashboards: Power BI, Tableau, Looker
    
- Reports: Scheduled or on-demand reports
    

---

#### 7. **Data Governance & Security**

Ensures data is secure, accurate, and compliant:

- Access control, encryption, masking
    
- Policies for data quality, lineage, compliance (e.g., GDPR)
