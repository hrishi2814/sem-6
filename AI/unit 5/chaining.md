**Forward chaining** and **backward chaining** are reasoning methods used in **rule-based expert systems** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** to derive conclusions from a set of facts and rules. Here’s a clear comparison of both:

---

### 🔁 **1. Forward Chaining (Data-Driven)**

#### 📌 Definition:

Starts with the known facts and applies inference rules to extract more data until a goal is reached.

#### 📈 Process:

- Start from **facts**.
    
- Apply **rules** whose **conditions match** the facts.
    
- **Generate new facts** from rule conclusions.
    
- Repeat until the **goal (conclusion)** is reached or no more rules apply.
    

#### ✅ Example:

**Rules:**

1. If it is raining, then the ground is wet.
    
2. If the ground is wet, then traffic will be slow.
    

**Fact:**

- It is raining.
    

**Chaining:**

- → Ground is wet → Traffic is slow.
    

#### 🔧 Usage:

- Used in **production systems**, **monitoring**, **data-driven systems**.
    
- **Proactive:** Derives all possible conclusions.

### 🔁 **2. Backward Chaining (Goal-Driven)**

#### 📌 Definition:

Starts with the goal (hypothesis) and works backward to determine which facts must be true to support that goal.

#### 📉 Process:

- Start from a **goal**.
    
- Look for a **rule** that could conclude that goal.
    
- Check if the **conditions** of the rule are true.
    
- If not, make those conditions new **sub-goals** and repeat.
    

#### ✅ Example:

**Goal:**

- Is traffic slow?
    

**Rules:**

1. If it is raining, then the ground is wet.
    
2. If the ground is wet, then traffic will be slow.
    

**Chaining:**

- Is traffic slow? → Is ground wet? → Is it raining?
    

If “it is raining” is true, then the goal is proven.

#### 🔧 Usage:

- Used in **diagnosis**, **planning**, **problem-solving systems** (e.g., **Prolog**).
    
- **Reactive:** Checks only what’s necessary to prove a specific goal.
