Here’s a **clear and structured comparison** between **[[Propositional Logic]]** and **[[First order logic]]**

### 🧠 **Propositional Logic vs First Order Logic**

|**Aspect**|**Propositional Logic**|**First Order Logic (FOL)**|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Basic Unit**|**Propositions** (simple, indivisible statements like `P`, `Q`)|**Predicates with variables** (e.g., `Loves(John, Mary)`)|
|**2. Expressiveness**|Less expressive – only handles whole statements as true/false|More expressive – can describe relationships between objects|
|**3. Structure**|No internal structure within propositions|Has internal structure with objects, predicates, and functions|
|**4. Quantifiers**|❌ Not supported|✅ Uses **Quantifiers**: – ∀ (for all) – ∃ (there exists)|
|**5. Variables**|❌ No variables – only constants and atomic propositions|✅ Variables are used to represent general statements|
|**6. Domain Representation**|Cannot represent a domain of objects|Can represent complex domains with **objects**, **relations**, **functions**|
|**7. Example Statement**|"It is raining" → `R`|"All humans are mortal" → ∀x (Human(x) → Mortal(x))|
|**8. Suitability**|Simple systems like digital circuits, rule-based systems|Complex AI systems needing reasoning over entities and relations|

### 🔑 **In Summary:**

- **Propositional Logic** is **simple**, good for basic reasoning.
    
- **First Order Logic** is **more powerful**, allowing reasoning about **objects, properties, and relationships**.
