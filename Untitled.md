Notable contributions to the Nix ecosystem:
- I am currently a little new to the Nix ecosystem, so I do not have any notable contributions to the Nix ecosystem

Projects I would like to work on:
- Openfire: https://github.com/ngi-nix/ngipkgs/issues/1002
 I’m interested in working on Openfire because it aligns well with my background in Java especially from my past work with Java Pathfinder (JPF). I'm comfortable navigating complex Java-based systems, and I’m eager to apply that experience to a real-time messaging server like Openfire. Its use of XMPP and plugins makes me excited as I really want to explore this part of software engineering

What I expect to gain from participating:
- Being able to work on real world projects with complexities that will teach me more about software engineering and networking and architectures in general. When I started contributing to jpf, although I didn't make a lot of PR's, I found its architecture very fascinating - it was a custom jvm built on top of the normal jvm.
- That experience taught me a lot and I intend to do a whole lot more open source contributions while I still have time in college, the exposure and the ideas have been crazy fascinating, I just have a whole lot of things to learn and this opportunity will definitely help me in getting more proficient in software engineering.
- I also want to learn more about how xmpp servers are engineered.
